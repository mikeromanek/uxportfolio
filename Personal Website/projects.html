        <h3>Personal Website Project</h3>
        <p>A fun landing page built with pure HTML and SCSS.</p>
        <p>I referenced the Branding Project for the color and typography of this website. In the future I hope to improve and add more in the future.</p>

        <h3>Personal Branding/Portfolio Project</h3>

        <h3>Poster Project</h3>
        <p>A poster design I created for a class project. We had to create, redesign, and refine over multiple iterations. About 5 times to be exact.</p>
        <p>This challenged me to think outside the box and completely break the mold of my original design.</p>
